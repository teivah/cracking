## Big O

Big O: upper bound
Big Omega: lower bound (fastest) 
Big Theta: Theta(N) if both O(N) and Omega(N)

O(2n) = O(n)
O(n2 + n) = O(n2)

O(n) may refer to time and space (memory)
Recursivity => space as each call is added to the call stack

Amortized time: worst case happens every x
Equals the sum of all operation costs divided by the number of operations

O(log n) => algorithms which starts with n elements, then n/2, then n/4 etc.
E.g. binary search in a sorted array
